Memory Allocation :-
                A fixed amount of memory is allocated for static data. This process is known as static memory allocation. 
                Heap: It is used to store objects and functions in JavaScript. The engine doesn't allocate a fixed amount of memory. 
                Instead, it allocates more space as required



EventLoop:-
        # An event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them, and then sleeps until it receives more tasks
        # The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. 
        The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.
